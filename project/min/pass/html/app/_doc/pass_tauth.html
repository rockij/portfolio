          "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License.
          "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.

          "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the Li-cense, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
          "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Deriva-tive Works thereof.
          "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifica-tions or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for in-clusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communica-tion on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communi-cation that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Con-tribution."
          "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.

          <h3>2. Grant of Copyright License.</h3>
          Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, world-wide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

          <h3>3. Grant of Patent License.</h3>
          Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, world-wide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribu-tion(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was sub-mitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

          <h3>4. Redistribution.</h3>
          You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
          a.	You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and 

          b.	You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and 

          c.	You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and 

          d.	If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display gener-ated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be con-strued as modifying the License.
          You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different li-cense terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Deriva-tive Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

          <h3>5. Submission of Contributions.</h3>
          Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or condi-tions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

          <h3>6. Trademarks.</h3>
          This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

          <h3>7. Disclaimer of Warranty.</h3>
          Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, ei-ther express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

          <h3>8. Limitation of Liability.</h3>
          In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (in-cluding but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

          <h3>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.</h3>
          While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, ac-ceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this Li-cense. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole re-sponsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

          2.4 Developer Feedback. From time to time, Crashlytics may solicit from Developer or Developer may make, in its sole discretion, suggestions for changes, modifications or improvements to the Crashlytics Properties (as defined below) or any other feedback related to Crashlytics or the Crashlytics Properties (collectively, "Devel-oper Feedback"). All Developer Feedback shall be solely owned by Crashlytics (including all intellectual proper-ty rights therein and thereto) and shall also be Crashlytics's confidential information. Developer hereby assigns all of its right, title and interest in and to any Developer Feedback to Crashlytics and acknowledges that Crashlytics has the unrestricted right to use and exploit such Developer Feedback in any manner, without at-tribution, and without any obligations or compensation to Developer.

          2.5 Developer Data. Developer hereby grants Crashlytics a nonexclusive, license fee free and royalty free right and license to access, copy, distribute, process and use all information, data and other content provided by Developer or received by Crashlytics in connection with Developer's authorized use of the Services, including, without limitation information provided through any Application or Beta Application that Developer makes available for testing through the Services (collectively, "Developer Data"), solely for the purpose of providing, developing, and maintaining the Services, along with any related customer or technical support, and as oth-erwise expressly permitted in this Agreement. Developer agrees that: (a) the Services depend on the availabil-ity of the Developer Data, and (b) Crashlytics will not assume any responsibility or liability for, or undertake to verify, the legality, accuracy or completeness of the Developer Data. Crashlytics shall have no obligation to store any Developer Data or Results (as defined below).

          2.6 Access by Beta Testers; EULA; End Users; Compliance. Developer shall provide to Crashlytics the contact information of any user of Developer's application(s) whom Developer intends to invite to become a Beta Tester. Developer is solely responsible for determining which users will receive an invitation to become a Beta Tester, and for ensuring the accuracy of any user contact information provided to Crashlytics. Developer may provide Beta Testers with its own EULA for a Beta Application that will be accessed by Beta Testers ("Devel-oper EULA"); provided that the Developer EULA provides terms and conditions consistent with this Agreement and, with respect to Crashlytics, no less protective than those terms and conditions set forth in the standard EULA provided in Appendix A ("Standard EULA"). If Developer does not provide a separate Developer EULA to Beta Testers in connection with Developer's Beta Application, then Developer acknowledges and agrees that such Beta Testers, by accessing the Beta Application through the Services, will be made subject to the terms and conditions of the Standard EULA between Developer and such Beta Testers. Developer acknowledges and agrees that Crashlytics provides the Standard EULA by way of convenience only, and does not represent or warrant that the Standard EULA will be enforceable under, or in compliance with, all applicable laws, rules, regulations, or otherwise. Developer acknowledges and agrees that the EULA applicable to Developer's Beta Application shall be between Developer and any Beta Tester, and Crashlytics shall not be responsible for, and shall not have any liability whatsoever for, such EULA, any application tested by a Beta Tester, or for any breach by Developer or any Beta Tester of the terms and conditions of such EULA. The Services allow the De-veloper to collect information relating to performance of Developer's applications, including, without limitation, device state information, unique device identifiers, information relating to the physical location of a device, and information about how the application was used. Developer may turn on features of the Services to allow collection of other information via the Services, including some personally identifiable information (e.g., a us-er's email address), which allows Developers to communicate with users about the engagement with and functionality of their applications and to invite them to become Beta Testers. Developer represents and war-rants that Developer is collecting information via the Services solely to obtain information about the user en-gagement with and functionality of Developer's applications, and to communicate with users about such en-gagement and functionality. Developer agrees that it will not enable collection of personally identifiable infor-mation via the Services unless it is necessary to communicate with users about the applications or Developer wishes to invite users to be Beta Testers and the user has provided affirmative consent to the collection and use of such information. Subject to and without limiting the foregoing, Developer agrees it will not enable collection or use of credit card information, Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers, dates of birth or physical addresses via the Services. Developer further agrees it will not invite any user to be a Beta Tester that is under the age of consent as defined under any applicable laws, rules, or regulations relating to data collection, including without limitation the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation or "GDPR"), and all other relevant laws and regulations. At all times during the term of this Agreement, Developer shall maintain a privacy policy: (a) that is readily accessible to users from its website or within its online service (as applicable), (b) that fully and accu-rately discloses to its users what information is collected about its users, and (c) that states that such infor-mation is disclosed to and processed by third party providers like Crashlytics in the manner contemplated by the Services, including, without limitation, disclosure of the use of technology to track users' activity and oth-erwise collect information from users. For Developer's users in the European Union, Developer shall provide such users with clear notice of, and obtain such users' consent to, the transfer, storage, and use of their in-formation in the United States and any other country where Crashlytics, or any third party service providers acting on its behalf, operates, and shall further notify such users that the privacy and data protection laws in some of these countries may vary from the laws in the country where such users live. Developer shall at all times comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to data collection, privacy and security, including without limitation, COPPA, GDPR, and all other such laws and regulations. Developer will obtain and maintain any required consents necessary and will comply with any other applicable requirements to permit the processing of Developer Data under this Agreement.

          2.7 Developer Systems. Developer is responsible for providing: (a) all equipment, subscriptions and credentials necessary for Crashlytics to receive the Developer Data, and (b) all modems, servers, devices, storage, software (other than Software), databases, network and communications equipment and ancillary services needed to connect to, access, or otherwise use the Services at its facility (collectively, "Developer Systems"). Developer shall ensure that Developer Systems are compatible with the Services and comply with all configurations and specifications described in the Documentation.

          2.8 Limitations. Crashlytics will not be responsible or liable for any failures in the Services or any other prob-lems which are related to: (a) the Developer Data or Developer Systems, or (b) any satellite, telecommunica-tions, network or other equipment or service outside of Crashlytics's facilities or control.

          2.9 Confidentiality. "Confidential Information" means any information disclosed by one party ("Discloser") to the other party ("Recipient") that is marked or otherwise identified as "confidential" or "proprietary," or by its nature or the circumstances of disclosure should reasonably be understood to be confidential, including without limitation, all financial, business or technical information disclosed in relation to this Agreement. Ex-cept for the specific rights granted by this Agreement, the Recipient may not use, copy or disclose any Confi-dential Information of the Discloser without Discloser's prior written consent, and shall use no less than rea-sonable care to safeguard Discloser's Confidential Information, including ensuring that Recipient's employees, contractors and agents ("Representatives")with access to Discloser's Confidential Information have a need to know such Confidential Information for the purposes of this Agreement and are bound by confidentiality ob-ligations no less protective of the parties as those set forth herein. The foregoing obligations shall not apply to any Confidential Information that Recipient can demonstrate is: (a) already known by it without restriction, (b) rightfully furnished to it without restriction by a third party not in breach of any obligation to Discloser, (c) generally available to the public without breach of this Agreement or (d) independently developed by it without reference to or use of any of Discloser's Confidential Information and without any violation of any obligation of this Agreement. Each party shall be responsible for any breach of confidentiality by its Repre-sentatives, as applicable. Promptly upon Discloser's request at any time, Recipient shall, or in the case of De-veloper Data shall use reasonable efforts to, return all of Discloser's tangible Confidential Information, perma-nently erase all Confidential Information from any storage media and destroy all information, records, copies, summaries, analyses and materials developed therefrom. Nothing herein shall prevent a party from disclosing any of the other's Confidential Information as necessary pursuant to any court order or any legal, regulatory, law enforcement or similar requirement or investigation; provided, however, prior to any such disclosure, Re-cipient shall use reasonable efforts to: (i) promptly notify Discloser in writing of such requirement to disclose where permitted by law, and (ii) cooperate with Discloser in protecting against or minimizing any such disclo-sure and/or obtaining a protective order.

          2.10 Proprietary Rights. As used in this Agreement: "Background Materials" means all ideas, concepts, inven-tions, systems, platforms, software (including all Software), interfaces, tools, utilities, templates, forms, Report Formats, techniques, methods, processes, algorithms, knowhow, trade secrets and other technologies and information that are used by Crashlytics in providing the Services and Results (including any correction, im-provement, derivative work, extension or other modification to the Services made, created, conceived or de-veloped by or for Crashlytics, including at Developer's request or as a result of feedback provided by Develop-er to Crashlytics); "Reports" means the reports, charts, graphs and other presentation in which the Results are presented to Developer; "Report Formats" means the formatting, look and feel of the Reports; and "Re-sults" means the work products resulting from the Services that are delivered to Developer by Crashlytics through the Services, and which are based on the Developer Data.

Developer acknowledges and agrees that the Results will be presented to it in a Re-port, the Report Format of which is Confidential Information and proprietary to Crashlytics. Developer may make a reasonable number of copies of the Reports only for its internal purposes in using the Results.

          2.11 General Learning; Aggregate Data. Crashlytics reserves the right to disclose aggregate information of Ser-vices usage, engagement, and performance, and to reuse all general knowledge, experience, knowhow, works and technologies (including ideas, concepts, processes and techniques) related to the Results or acquired during provision of the Services (including without limitation, that which it could have acquired performing the same or similar services for another customer).

          2.12 Reservation of Rights. Except for the limited rights and licenses expressly granted hereunder, no other license is granted, no other use is permitted and Crashlytics (and its licensors) shall retain all right, title, and interest (including all intellectual property and proprietary rights embodied therein) in and to the Services, Software, Documentation, Background Materials, aggregate data, and analyses (collectively, "Crashlytics Prop-erties").

          SECTION 3. SPECIFIC TERMS FOR BETA TESTERS

          3.4 No Compensation. By becoming a Beta Tester, you are acting as a volunteer. You will bear your own costs, including any mobile carrier and data costs that you incur in connection with your use of the Beta Applica-tion or any User Feedback (defined above) that you submit.

          3.5 Standard EULA for Beta Applications. You agree to comply with the terms of the Standard EULA in con-nection with your access and use of any Beta Application of a Developer, unless you agree to comply with a separate license agreement that the Developer provides in connection with such Beta Application, in which case the terms of that separate license agreement will govern.

          SECTION 4. WARRANTY, LIABILITY & INDEMNITY
          4.1 Warranties. Crashlytics represents and warrants that it has full right, power, and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations and duties under this Agreement, and that the performance of such obligations and duties does not conflict with or result in a breach of any other agreement of Crashlytics, or any judgment, order, or decree by which such party is bound. Developer's sole and exclusive remedy for any and all breaches of this provision is the remedy set forth in Section 4.4. Developer represents and war-rants that it owns all right, title and interest, or possesses sufficient license rights, in and to the Developer Data as may be necessary to grant the rights and licenses, and provide the representations, and for Crash-lytics to provide the Services set forth herein. Developer bears all responsibility and liability for the legality, accuracy and completeness of the Developer Data and Crashlytics's access, possession, distribution, and use thereof, as permitted herein.

          4.2 Disclaimers. THE CRASHLYTICS SERVICES, CRASHLYTICS PROPERTIES AND RESULTS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, CRASHLYTICS AND ITS PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, RELATED COMPANIES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, REPRESENTA-TIVES, PARTNERS AND LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY, THE "CRASHLYTICS ENTITIES") MAKE NO WARRANTY: (A) THAT THE SERVICES OR RESULTS WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR FREE OR BUGFREE, (B) REGARDING THE RELIABILITY, TIMELINESS, OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES, OR (C) THAT ANY ERRORS IN THE SERVICES CAN OR WILL BE CORRECTED. THE CRASHLYTICS ENTITIES HEREBY DISCLAIM (FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR SUPPLIERS) ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRIT-TEN, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABIL-ITY, TITLE OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM ANY COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE.

          4.3 Claims Against Crashlytics. Developer will defend Crashlytics from all third party claims, whether actual or alleged (collectively, "Crashlytics Claims"), and will indemnify Crashlytics and hold Crashlytics harmless from any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) resulting from such Crashlytics Claims that arise out of Developer's: (a) use of the Services, (b) actual or alleged infringement or misappropriation of the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, any intellectual property rights, privacy rights or publicity rights, and (c) breach of any representations and warranties set forth in the Agreement. Developer is solely responsible for defending any such Crashlytics Claims, subject to Crashlytics's right to participate with counsel of its own choosing, and for payment of all judgments, settlements, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting from such Claims against Crashlytics, provided that Developer will not agree to any settlement related to any such Crashlytics Claims without Crashlytics's prior express written consent regardless of whether or not such settlement releases Crashlytics from any obligation or liability. If Developer uses the Services in an official capacity as an employee or representative of a United States federal, state, or local government entity and is legally unable to accept this indemnification provision, then it does not apply to such entity, but only to the extent required by appli-cable law.

          4.4 Claims Against Developer. Crashlytics will defend the Developer from all third party claims, actions, suits, or proceedings, whether actual or alleged (collectively, "Developer Claims"), and will indemnify Developer and hold Developer harmless from any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable at-torney's fees) resulting from such Developer Claims, that arise out of an allegation that the Services, when used as expressly permitted by this Agreement, infringes the intellectual property rights of such third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Crashlytics will have no obligation under this Section 4.4 or otherwise with respect to any infringement claim based upon: (a) any use of the Services not expressly permitted under this Agreement; (b) any use of the Services in combination with products, equipment, software, or data not made available by Crashlytics if such infringement would have been avoided without the combination with such other products, equipment, software, or data; (c) any modification of the Services by any person other than Crashlytics or its authorized agents or subcontractors; or (d) any claim not clearly based on the Services itself. This Section 4.4 states Crashlytics's entire liability and Developer's sole and exclusive remedy for all third party claims.

          4.5 Procedure. The foregoing obligations are conditioned on the party seeking indemnification: (a) promptly notifying the other party in writing of such claim; (b) giving the other party sole control of the defense there-of and any related settlement negotiations; and (c) cooperating and, at the other party's request and expense, assisting in such defense. Neither party may make any public announcement of any claim, defense or settle-ment without the other party's prior written approval. The indemnifying party may not settle, compromise or resolve a claim without the consent of the indemnified party, if such settlement, compromise or resolution (i) causes or requires an admission or finding of guilt against the indemnified party, (i) imposes any monetary damages against the indemnified party, or (iii) does not fully release the indemnified party from liability with respect to the claim.

          4.6 Limitation of Liability.

          (a) IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EX-EMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR FOR ANY DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH ANY LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS, PROFITS, OR GOOD-WILL OR FOR INTERRUPTION, LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA OR NETWORKS.

          (b) IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED FIFTY ($50.00) DOLLARS (USD).

          (c) THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL NOT APPLY TO BREACHES OF CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS OR FOR MISAPPROPRIATION OR INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND SHALL APPLY NOT-WITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ANY REMEDY PROVIDED HEREIN.

          THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS SHALL APPLY TO ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, RE-GARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to You. INSOFAR AS APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS ANY LIMITATION ON LIABILITY HEREIN, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT SUCH LIMITATION WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY MODIFIED, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT SO AS TO MAKE THE LIM-ITATION COMPLIANT WITH APPLICABLE LAW.

          SECTION 5. TERM AND TERMINATION
          5.1 Term. The term of this Agreement will begin on the date you first agree to this Agreement and are ap-proved to register for the Services, and continue until terminated as set forth herein ("Term").

          5.2 Effects of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement, all rights, obligations and licenses of the parties shall cease, except that: (a) all obligations that accrued prior to the effective date of termination and all remedies for breach of this Agreement shall survive, (b) you must discontinue accessing and using the Services and delete all Software, Crashlytics Properties, and Crashlytics Material, and (c) the provisions in Section 2 titled Restrictions, Developer Feedback, Confidentiality, Proprietary Rights, General Learning; Aggregate Data, the provisions of Section 4 and the provisions in this Section 5 shall survive.

          6.2 Waivers, Consents and Amendments. No waiver, consent, or modification of this Agreement shall bind the Crashlytics Entities unless in writing and signed by Crashlytics. Crashlytics may amend this Agreement from time to time. If we make a change to this Agreement that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you at the email address that you provided upon signing up to access the Services or upon signing up to access the Crashlytics Fabric services, at crashlytics.com, or otherwise through the Services. If you do not agree to the modified terms, you shall notify Crashlytics in writing within thirty (30) days, after which your right to access and use the Services shall immediately terminate and the Crashlytics Entities shall have no fur-ther responsibility or liability to you. The failure of either party to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any period will not be construed as a waiver of such rights.

          6.3 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.

          6.4 Governing Law and Disputes. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions.

          (a) Except as set forth in Section 6.4(b) below, all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Services ("Disputes") will be governed by California law, excluding California's conflict of laws rules, and all Dis-putes will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and You and Crashlytics consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.

          (b) If Your principal place of business (for entities) or place of residence (for individuals) is in any country within APAC (other than Australia, Japan, New Zealand or Singapore) or Latin America, this Section 6.4(b) will apply instead of Section 6.4(a) above. ALL DISPUTES (AS DEFINED ABOVE) WILL BE GOVERNED BY CALIFORNIA LAW, EXCLUDING CALIFORNIA'S CONFLICT OF LAWS RULES.The parties will try in good faith to settle any Dis-pute within 30 days after the Dispute arises. If the Dispute is not resolved within 30 days, it must be resolved by arbitration by the American Arbitration Association's International Centre for Dispute Resolution in accord-ance with its Expedited Commercial Rules in force as of the date of this Agreement ("Rules"). The parties will mutually select one arbitrator. The arbitration will be conducted in English in Santa Clara County, California, USA. Either party may apply to any competent court for injunctive relief necessary to protect its rights pend-ing resolution of the arbitration. The arbitrator may order equitable or injunctive relief consistent with the remedies and limitations in this Agreement. Subject to the confidentiality requirements in of this Agreement, either party may petition any competent court to issue any order necessary to protect that party's rights or property; this petition will not be considered a violation or waiver of this governing law and arbitration sec-tion and will not affect the arbitrator's powers, including the power to review the judicial decision. The parties stipulate that the courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, are competent to grant any order under this subsection. The arbitral award will be final and binding on the parties and its execution may be presented in any competent court, including any court with jurisdiction over either party or any of its property.

The parties will pay the arbitrator's fees, the arbitrator's appointed experts' fees and expenses, and the arbitration center's administrative expenses in accordance with the Rules. In its final decision, the arbitrator will determine the non-prevailing party's obligation to reimburse the amount paid in advance by the prevailing party for these fees. Each party will bear its own lawyers' and ex-perts' fees and expenses, regardless of the arbitrator's final decision.

          6.6 Notices.

Any assignment or transfer in violation of the foregoing shall automatically be null and void, and Crashlytics may immediately terminate this Agreement upon such an attempt.
